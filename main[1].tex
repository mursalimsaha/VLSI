This project focuses on the full custom ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) design using Cadence Virtuoso, along with the functional implementation of digital logic circuits using Verilog in Vivado software.\\
In the Cadence Virtuoso environment ,fundamental logic gates such as CMOS inverters, NOR, NAND and XOR gates were designed. Additionally D flipflop, 2x1 multiplexer(MUX) using transmission gate logic, 4x1 multiplexer(MUX) using 2x1 MUX was constructed .The entire design flow was beginning with the schematic creation and symbol generation for each gate. After functional verification through simulation, layout designs were built for all circuits using standard CMOS design rules. Each layout was thoroughly verified using Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) to ensure correctness. Finally, extracted views were generated for each design to perform post-layout power analysis, and the results were compared with the schematic-level estimates.Some key performance metrics such as propagation delay,power dissipation were calculated and compared across the designs.\\
In Parallel,digital logic circuits were implemented using verilog in Vivado software including design and simulation of a 4-bit up counter,4-bit down counter,4-bit updown counter,half adder and full adder. These designs validate the functional correctness of combinational and sequential digital systems.

\section{Introduction}
\label{int}
Due to the ever-changing environment in the field of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration), there is a growing need for application-specific, high-performance integrated circuits (ASICs) in various applications such as consumer electronics, embedded applications, and communication systems. ASIC design can be customized to have circuit behavior tailored to needs, performance improved at optimized points, and power consumed at a minimum; therefore, it is an important part of today's electronic systems.\\
This book spans the complete flow of the full custom ASIC design using Cadence Virtuoso with an emphasis on the transistor-level design and verification of the simple digital building blocks. With the assistance provided by the Cadence environment, there is precise control over the devices' sizing, verification and layout optimization steps such as Design Rule Check (DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) checking, and parasitic extraction.\\
Simultaneously, the functional nature of corresponding digital logic circuits is translated with the help of Verilog and is simulated with Xilinx Vivado. Not only does this dual method furnish an understanding of the disparity amongst ASIC as well as FPGA design approaches but also solidifies the comprehension regarding the physical and functional design aspects of the digital system. The implementation with the help of Verilog consists of a range of combinational and sequential circuits including adders and counters that confirm the theoretical models applied within the ASIC design.\\
This report summarizes the design flow and design considerations for the custom ASIC circuits and the Verilog-based FPGA implementations with simulation results and performance analysis. Overall observations regarding current digital system design flows are also provided.

\section{Motivation}
%\begin{itemize}
  Increasing needs for high-performance and low-power electronic systems have stimulated enormous innovation in the design of Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASICs). In this context, gaining hands-on experience with full custom ASIC design and with hardware description languages has been valuable in understanding the flows of semiconductor developments that happen around the world.

This project is motivated by the need to bridge the theory-based VLSI concepts vs. design methodologies applied in practice for chips. Utilizing the Cadence Virtuoso, a professional-grade full custom IC design software, we explore the realization of the transistor-level digital circuit with focus on performance, area, and power optimization. On the other hand, the Verilog code implementation with Vivado allows us to transition from the RTL-level design into the field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which are used for rapid prototyping and verification of the digital logic.

Merging the two enables an integrated grasp of the design process from the high-level code to layout-ready silicon. A dual-track strategy is a requirement for the contemporary engineer who should be competent with the HDL-based design as much as with the physical implementation. The project improves practical skills in addition to offering a better understanding and appreciation of the developments and challenges in the design of ASIC.

\section{Current Status}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% copy pasted%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The project is currently in an advanced stage of development. In the Cadence Virtuoso environment, the schematic design, layout generation, and DRC/LVS verification for fundamental logic circuits—including CMOS inverters, NOR, NAND, XOR gates, D flip-flop, 2×1 MUX, and 4×1 MUX—have been successfully completed. Both pre-layout and post-layout simulations have been conducted, and parasitic extraction has been performed to evaluate circuit behavior and accuracy.

Performance metrics such as propagation delay, static power dissipation, and dynamic power consumption have been calculated for all designed circuits. Parallel to this, the Verilog implementation of digital logic circuits has been completed in Xilinx Vivado. Functional simulation of a 4-bit up counter, 4-bit down counter, 4-bit up-down counter, half adder, and full adder has been successfully performed, confirming the correctness of both combinational and sequential logic designs.

\section{Full Custom ASIC Design Using Cadence Virtuoso\label{def}}
In digital electronics, logic gates are the fundamental building blocks used to implement Boolean functions. CMOS technology, which uses a combination of PMOS and NMOS transistors, enables the design of these gates with high noise margins, low power consumption, and reliable performance. Below are the common basic logic gates, their CMOS implementation concepts, and corresponding truth tables.

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Region-1}
In this region the input is in the range of (0,Vtn). Since the input voltage is less than Vtn, the NMOS is in cutoff region. No current flows from Vdd to Vss, The entire Vdd will appear at the Output terminal. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item NMOS is in cutoff as Vgs < Vtn
\item PMOS is in linear as Vgsp < Vtp and Vdsp > Vgsp -Vtp.
\item Zero current flows from supply voltage and the power dissipation is zero.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Region-2}
In this region the input is in the range of (Vtn,Vdd/2). Since the input voltage is greater than Vtn the NMOS is conducting and it jumps to saturation as it has large Vds across it(Vout is high). PMOS still remains in the linear region.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item NMOS is in saturation as Vgs > Vtn and Vout >Vin - Vtn.
\item PMOS is in linear region as Vdsp > Vgsp -Vtp.
\item since both the transistors are conducting some amount of current flows from supply in this region.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Region-3}
In this region the input voltage is Vdd/2. At this point the output voltage is also Vdd/2 as one can see in figure-2. At this voltage both the NMOS and PMOS are in saturation and the output drops drastically from Vdd to Vdd/2. At this point a large amount of current flows from the supply. Most of the power consumed in CMOS inverter is at this point. So care should be taken that the Input should not stay at Vdd/2 for more amount of time.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item NMOS is in saturation as Vgs > Vtn and Vout >Vin - Vtn.
    \item PMOS is in saturation as Vgsp < Vtp and Vdsp < Vgsp -Vtp.
    \item Large amount of current is drawn from supply and hence large power dissipation.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Region-4}
In this region the input voltage is in the range of (Vdd/2 , Vdd-Vtp). Here the PMOS remains in saturation as Vout < Vin - Vtp and Vgsp < Vtp. But the NMOS moves from saturation to linear region since the drain to source voltage now is less than Vgsn-Vtn.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item NMOS is in linear as Vgs > Vtn and Vout < Vin - Vtn.
\item PMOS is in saturation as Vgsp < Vtp and Vdsp < Vgsp -Vtp.
\item A medium amount of current is drawn as NMOS is in linear region and power dissipation is low.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Region-5}
In this region the input voltage is in the range of (Vdd-Vtp,Vdd). Here the PMOS moves from saturation to cutoff as the Vgsp is so high that Vgsp > Vtp. The NMOS still remains linear as the drain-to-source voltage now is less than Vgsn-Vtn.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item NMOS is in linear as Vgs > Vtn and Vout < Vin - Vtn.
\item PMOS is in cutoff as Vgsp > Vtp.
\item Zero current flows from the supply and so the power dissipation is zero.

\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Propagation Delay of CMOS inverter }

        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When input goes from low to high PMOS is OFF \& NMOS of ON. So $C_{load}$ gets discharging via NMOS.
        \item When input goes from high to low PMOS is ON \& NMOS of OFF. So $C_{load}$ gets charging via PMOS.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{figure}[H]

    \end{figure}

\textbf{Switching speed} - limited by time taken to charge and discharge, CL. \\
\textbf{Rise time, tr}: waveform to rise from 10\% to 90\% of its steady state value\\
\textbf{Fall time tf}: 90\% to 10\% of steady state value\\
\textbf{Delay time, td}: time difference between input transition (50\%) and 50\% output level.\\
The  propagation  delay  tp of  a  gate  defines  how  quickly  it  responds  to  a  change  at  its  inputs, it expresses the delay experienced by a signal when passing through a gate. It is measured  between  the  50\%  transition  points  of  the  input  and  output  waveforms. The $\tau_{pLH}$ defines the response time of the gate for a low to high output transition, while $\tau_{pHL}$  refers to a high to low transition. The propagation delay $\tau_{p}$ as the average of the two.
\[
\tau_p = \frac{(\tau_{pLH} + \tau_{pHL})}{2}
\]

 Hence, it can be concluded that the layout is accurate and closely matches to the original schematic in terms of average power consumption. This consistency validates the correctness of the design flow from schematic capture to physical layout within the EDA environment.

     \subsection{\large{\textbf{D Flipflop}}}
     \subsubsection{\textbf{Basic Concept}}
        D flip flop is an electronic devices that is known as "delay flip flop" or "data flip flop" which is used to store single bit of data.
    
        A D flip-flop is created by modifying an SR flip-flop. The S input is connected to the D input, and the R input is connected to the inverted D input. As a result, a D flip-flop functions similarly to an SR flip-flop, but with complementary inputs, preventing any possibility of an invalid intermediate state. One major issue with the SR flip-flop is the race around condition, which is eliminated in the D flip-flop due to the inverted inputs. The circuit diagram of the D flip-flop is shown in the figure below:
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Screenshot 2025-07-06 223135.png}
        \caption{D flipflop}
        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{\textbf{Working of D Flipflop}}
    D flip flop consist of a single input D and two outputs (Q and Q'). The basic working of D Flip Flop is as follows:

    When the clock signal is low, the flip flop holds its current state and ignores the D input.
    When the clock signal is high, the flip flop samples and stores D input.
    The value that was previously fed into the D input is reflected at the flip flop's Q output.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If D = 0 then Q will be 0.
        \item If D = 1 then Q will be 1.
    \end{itemize}
    The Q' output of the flip flop is complemented by the Q output. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  If Q = 0 then Q' will be 1.
        \item If Q = 1 then Q' will be 0.
    \end{itemize}

    \caption{Truth Table}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

   
    \subsubsection{Characteristic Equation of D Flip Flop}
        \[
        Q_{n+1} = D
        \]
        This states "that the output of the flip flop at the next clock cycle will be equal to the input at the current clock cycle".

    \subsubsection{Characteristic Table of D Flip Flop}

        \caption{Characteristic Table}
        \label{fig:enter-label}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item D is the input, and Q is current state, Q(n+1) is the next state outputs.
        \item Q(n+1) will always be zero when D is 0, irrespective of current state of flip flop.
        \item When the input of the flip flop is 1,  next state of  flip flop will always be 1, regardless of the current state of flip flop.
    \end{itemize}

    \end{figure}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item When the Q(n) is 0 and the D(n) is also 0, then the Q(n+1) becomes 0. This situation explains the condition of "hold" state.
        \item When the Q(n) is 0 but D(n) is 1, then the Q(n+1) becomes 1. This situation explains the condition of "set" state.
        \item When the Q(n) is 1 but D(n) is 0, then the Q(n+1) becomes 0. This situation explains the condition of "reset" state.
        \item When the Q(n) is 1 and the D(n) is also 1, then the Q(n+1) becomes 1. This situation explains the condition of "hold" state.

 \subsection{\large{\textbf{4x1 Multiplexer}}}

   The 4x1 Multiplexer which is also known as the 4-to-1 multiplexer. It is a multiplexer that has 4 inputs and a single output. The Output is selected as one of the 4 inputs which is based on the selection inputs. The number of the Selection lines will depend on the number of the input which is determined by the equation \[ \log_{2}n \]In 4x1 Mux the selection lines can be determined as \[ \log_{2}4=2 \] So two selection lines  are needed.

\section{Implementation Of Verilog Code In Vivado \label{def}}
In today’s digital electronics, designing and testing circuits with hardware description languages like Verilog has become a standard practice. By the help of Vivado(developed by Xilinx) writing, simulating, and verification of Verilog designs are done, especially for FPGA-based applications.

In this project, I used Vivado to implement and simulate a set of basic digital circuits in Verilog included Half Adder, Full Adder, 4-bit Up Counter, 4-bit Down Counter and 4-bit Up-Down Counter.

The focus was on writing code and simulation. While the circuits were not implemented on physical hardware, I thoroughly tested their functionality using Vivado tools. This confirmed the logic’s correctness and enhanced understanding of essential digital design concepts.

\subsection{Half Adder}
\subsubsection{What is Half Adder?}
The half
adder adds two binary digits and produces two outputs as
sum and carry. It consists of one XOR logic gate producing
“SUM” and one AND gate producing “CARRY” as outputs.

\subsection{Full Adder}
\subsubsection{What is Full Adder?}
A full adder is a combinational circuit that performs an
addition operation on three binary digits. It consists of three
inputs and two outputs. The first two inputs are A and B and
the third input is an input carry designated as Cin. The
output carry is designated as Carry and the normal output is
designated as Sum.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Screenshot 2025-07-08 213545.png}
    \caption{Block Diagram of Full Adder}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

A full adder circuit can be implemented using two half adders
and one OR gate. The first half adder will be used to add A
and B to produce a partial Sum and the second half adder
can be used to add Cin to the Sum produced by the first half
adder to get the final S output. If any of the half adder
produces a carry, there will be an output carry. So, Cout will
be an OR function of the half adder Carry outputs.

\subsection{4-bit Up Counter}
\subsubsection{What is a 4-Bit Up Counter?}
A 4-bit up counter is a digital circuit that counts numbers from 0 to 15.  It uses binary numbers (0 and 1) to represent each value.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The counter works like a memory which uses flip-flops to store count.

    \item Every time circuit receives a clock pulse, the counter increases its value by 1( counter=counter+1) for every rising edge of the clock.
    
    \item When it reaches the highest number 15, it reset to 0 and starts counting again.
    
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{4-bit down Counter}
\subsubsection{What is a 4-Bit Down Counter?}
A 4-bit down counter is a digital circuit that counts numbers in reverse from 15 to 0. It uses binary numbers (0 and 1) to represent each value.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The counter behaves like memory.It uses flip-flops to store current count.

    \item Each time the circuit receives a clock pulse, the counter decreases its value by 1 (counter = counter - 1) for every rising edge of the clock.
    
    \item When it reaches the lowest value 0, it reset and starts counting again from 15.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{4-bit up-down Counter}
\subsubsection{What is a 4-bit Up-Down Counter?}
A 4-bit up-down counter is a digital circuit which can count both upward (from 0 to 15) and downward (from 15 to 0) depending on the control signal.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The counter acts as memory by using flip-flop to store count value.

    \item It receives a clock pulse to update count value. If the control signal is set to 'up', the counter increases its value by 1 (counter = counter + 1). If the signal is set to 'down', it decreases it's value by 1 (counter = counter - 1).

    \item When it reaches the lowest value 0, it reset and starts counting again from 15.When counting up,it reset and starts counting again from 15 to 0. When counting down, it reset and starts counting again from 0 to 15.
